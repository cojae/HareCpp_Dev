# HareCpp_Dev

Work in progress for the HareCpp repository.  So that i can have more eyes on it for peer review, i have created this temporary Dev repository.  It will hold the code while it is being worked on.  But please do not look at this as a final product, my naming conventions are a little wacky and there are about 30 Todos floating around the codebase.  

Hopefully this will be cleaned up in the next week or so, but until then I'd like to start receiving input on the design decisions I have made.  Yes, i know some methods start with uppercase while some don't, I am moving my style over to more like golang style (capital first letter for public facing methods), I have not been able to get it 100% consistent yet as other things have been taking my focus away from it.  So please bear with me with things like that.  Again, it requires a great deal of cleaning
